# odin-rock-paper-scissors

Write a rock paper scissors program that:

WHEN the user inputs either rock, paper, or scissors:
    IF the input is capitalized in any way, change it to lowercase
    
    IF there is no input or the wrong input, return an error message asking them to choose rock, paper, or scissors

WHEN the user submits their input:
    Save user input into a variable, then compare with a computer's randomly generated choice using Math.random()

WHEN the user wins/loses:
    IF they want to play again, have a retry button that resets everything
